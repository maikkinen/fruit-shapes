# fruit-shapes
A sweet, fruity app to learn to create SVG assets and then animate them with CSS animations.

The live demo is available here: https://fruit-ml-demo.netlify.app/

Despite it's size, the app has an ambitious goal: to demonstrate how machine learning (algorithm) works.

The app visualizes the main steps:
  1. algorithm is introduced a set of images (which are cute fruits, in this case)
  2. at the beginning, a user tells the machine what's correct and what's wrong
  3. through (several) examples, the algorithm "learns" to recognize patterns, and thus
  4. learns to "recognize" meaningful things from images.
