# fruit-shapes
A sweet mini app to learn CSS animations, based on W. Scott Mean's course Interactive Animations with CSS and JavaScript.

Despite it's size, the app has an ambitious goal: it demonstrates how machine learning (algorithm) works.
The app visualizes the critical steps:
  1. algorithm is introduced a set of images (which are simple shapes, in this case)
  2. at the beginning, a user tells the machine what's correct and what's wrong
  3. through (several) examples, it "learns" to recognize patterns

The course is available e.g. on LinkedinLearning, and I do recommend it - even if the outcome is rather simple, Scott mentions
many things as "nice to know facts", but such "sidenotes" deepened my understanding on HTML5, JS and CSS and even bridged a couple of blind spots.

As I'm done with the functionalities, the next step will be to replace the geometric shapes with similar fruit svg (animations) - hence the name.

Ultimately, the goal is to make the fruit animations (tbd. whether the movement is created with keyframes or what) colorful and cute.
