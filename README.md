# fruit-shapes
Two fruity apps:

a) The 'original one', made with raw CSS/HTML : https://fruit-ml-demo.netlify.app/ and 
b) the spin-off version, which uses GSAP for more bouncy animations: https://juicy-fruits.netlify.app/ (currently Chrome support only)

Despite it's size, the original app has an ambitious goal: to demonstrate how machine learning (algorithm) works.

The app visualizes the main steps:
  1. algorithm is introduced a set of images (which are cute fruits, in this case)
  2. at the beginning, a user tells the machine what's correct and what's wrong
  3. through (several) examples, the algorithm "learns" to recognize patterns, and thus
  4. learns to "recognize" meaningful things from images.

The spin-off version has the same original structure and layout - other than that, it's very different. The animations have been buitl with JavaScript and GSAP.
